Dear Mohammed,

If you don't want to commit a file name myfile.txt for example. you need to do the following steps

* open gitbash command prompt in the project directory

* do the following commands

> touch .gitignore
> echo "myfile.txt" > .gitignore
> cat .gitignore
touch will create a new file (.gitignore)

echo put `myfile.txt` word into the .gitingore file

cat is used to make sure that the contents of the .gitignore is `myfile.txt`

It will be matched at any file directory location. No need to define the file path.

Good luck

Osama
